Today I received a Facebook message from someone in Peru whom I didn't know.

This is not a unique experience because there is an ever-increasing group of people in Peru that know that I specialize in child sexual abuse and its adult survivors. I get contacted by people who are in crisis, or who want to help someone in crisis. Some I continue to help, others never contact me again.

Today I received a Facebook message from some I didn't know. Let's call her Laura, who between politeness and tears tells me that a good friend of hers tried to kill herself yesterday, drinking rat poison, unsuccessfully. The friend is alive in a hospital in a Peruvian province getting basic medical care. Laura tells me that although she knows her friend for a long while, she just heard her Story.

Her Story.

Story. There are two Stories for a survivor, actually. The Story they know before therapy, and the Story after when so much Wisdom has been generated and integrated into their hearts, bodies and souls.

So it is a bi-level Story. A sneaky Story, an iceberg Story, I like to call it. With the Pre-Wisdom Story as the top of the iceberg. And the Post-Wisdom Story as the complete iceberg, huge, submerged, massive, scary, intimidating but nevertheless a full iceberg like it deserves to be seen.

Laura got the top of the iceberg today and she can't stop crying.

Her friend told her that she tried to kill herself because she can't live with the pain of the memories of what happened to her as a little girl. Laura proceeds to tell me a sentence that, although it make have many more pieces of information, needs nothing else.When she was about three years old her mother who was a sex worker would bring men to the house to service them and these men also sexually abused her, while her mother watched.

She watched.

And didn't help her, but allowed it and now her daughter tried to kill herself. But it didn't work.

Laura cries because she can't believe there can be such evil in the world and she knows that as she speaks there are other children being hurt this way.

I listen to her, rearranging my thoughts, rearranging a system in my head, an ABC of survival, a 1-2-3 of psychotherapy triage.

First things first, Laura, I feel that there are two issues here to begin with.

You need support, you need to be held, I need to know how you are feeling in your body at the moment. I would like to know if you are feeling triggered, if there is anything that is coming up for you right now?

Laura tells me that, it is pain she feels, not being triggered, although she has her own experiences with her body being "transgressed", she tells me.

Okay, I say. She asks me how she can help her friend. Her voice is tired, she kinda doesn't want to help, I sense. She is afraid. And why shouldn't she feel this way when this kind of suffering is like a live grenade inside a body, threatening to explode anytime, killing the host. In this case, the grenade detonated, it almost killed the host. Almost.

Why should anyone fashion themselves as a grenade removal surgeon?

If it is hard to find a psychotherapist genuinely skilled in helping survivors of childhood sexual abuse in North America, in Peru is almost impossible. Peru is the country that refuses to allow pregnant girl children to abort after a rape. This is the country where patriarchy and misogyny rule the constitution.

I can't remember how many stories I have been told, of survivors going to psychotherapists and being told such horrid things that it has set the survivors back. They have gone into their caves of self-protection, where the suffering is contained yet draining, to at the very least not be hurt by other humans. They chose to be hurt by their demons. At least they know their kind of damage, they use old well-known weapons.

There is a terrible precedent, Laura, I am afraid. To acquire the rat poison, to open the cap, to lift the arm with the container at hand, to put it in her mouth, to fill her mouth and to swallow said poison, has created a neurological path, an spiritual warrior action, a cause and effect that can not be erased. Will not be erased but that needs to be contextualized, to be taken out of the ocean of mindless pain.

I am worried, Laura. I am worried for you friend. I am worried for you.

I start my well known spiel about what can be done next. This option, the other, the best, the better, the something-is-something option. I continue with my optimistic spiel: This type of damage can be helped, can be soothed, can be overcome, can be transformed.

Incest is a bitch, though.

Incest is the motherfucker of all sufferings because it cuts with a sharp hateful knife the attachment needs of little human beings.  It shreds it without mercy. How do you come back from that?

You come back with tenacity, with courage, with faith, with love, with therapeutic skill. You come back not like you used to be before, because maybe there was no "you before". You come back from hell, rearranged, warrior-fied, healed, with your pieces all together, bonded with fire and God-given gold.

At this point, dear Laura, if she is not able to find an specialist of sexual abuse, you can still give her something precious. You can still help her.

It is what is hidden, whether it is conscious or drowned (unconscious) that is killing her, literally. She can no longer hold on to the pain. The dam broke of the torrent of the pain. She said no more.

You can listen to her story, her stories, her memories. Do not probe, do not push.

Be a receptacle, be a bowl. A crystal bowl, bottomless and compassionate. Listen, listen well.

Assure her that you can take this pain. Assure her that this will not break you. Because one common impediment to healing is for survivors to try to protect us from the horrors.

Imagine that.

They want to_protect__us!_Isn't their love, their care, their compassion for others (rarely for themselves) so great as to want deliver us from evil?

Deliver us from the evil they experienced and experience even now by their own neurology, their own mind.

Laura, please be the vessel, be the crystal bowl, and take care of yourself.

Please take care of yourself.
